# Analytics Guidence

A lot of work needs to be done before the value of analytics can be leveraged. You are building on top of the work of other people. Therefore, there is a lot of pre-work, learning and understanding to do before you can apply what you have learned in this project.

Use the following link to research Analyics in an IOT context and the value it can deliver:

When you feel like you have a solid understanding of the value analytics can bring, I will give you access to a tutorial.

The purpose of the tutorial is to introduce you to what a thing works analytics can do.
Once you have completed the tutorial, you need to apply what you have learned from first principles. You will need to answer the following questions:
What data can we collect?
How can we create useful metrics to enrich the data for a model?
What statistics can we introduce to start building a dataset.
Your task is to create a vision for how analytics can be used for this projectâ€™s use case, and start to implement it.
