# Project Management Guidence:

Your task is to lead an Agile team.

In your role as Project Managers, you need to know the tasks of the partisipants. You are responsible for the whole team finishing the tasks on time, to a high standard.

Here is the link to Jira: https://atiode.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/MAK/boards/2

- Call regular stand up meetings.

- Document the project on Jira to track the tasks of each team, their progress and to calculate how they can be helped.
  If you have not used Jira before, here is a helpful video:

- Mix the teams so they do not work in silos. You have the power to move your colleages around. You need to identifiy where teams have to interface with one another. For example, you will need to call together the Data Engieers, the UI/UX team, the ThingWorx Backend Team and the Analytics teams at different stages, in order that each team can compleate their objectives.

Get everybody to interact with the robot.

Remind people do not forget to organise their presentations.

## Laptops

You are in charge of distrubuting the Atio laptops between the different groups.

Each group gets atleast one laptop. The hard drive of these laptops has been cloned, so each have the same tools.

| makeathon 02    | UI/UX              |
| makeathon 03    | Data Team          |
| makeathon 04    | ThingWorx Backend  |
| makeathon 05    | Analytics          |
| makeathon 06    |                    |
| makeathon 07    |                    |
| makeathon 08    |                    |

Robot team, probably do not require an Atio laptop, although you will be required to find them one if they want to work on their presentation on the Atio laptop.
