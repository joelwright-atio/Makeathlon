# Project Management Guidance:

Your task is to lead an Agile team.

In your role as Project Managers, you need to know the tasks of the participants. You are responsible for the whole team finishing the tasks on time, to a high standard.

Here is the link to Jira: https://atiode.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/MAK/boards/2

- Call regular stand up meetings.

- Document the project on Jira to track the tasks of each team, their progress and to calculate how they can be helped.
  If you have not used Jira before, here is a helpful video:

- Mix the teams so they do not work in silos. You have the power to move your colleagues around. You need to identify where teams have to interface with one another. For example, you will need to call together the Data Team, the UI/UX team, the ThingWorx Backend Team and the Analytics teams at different stages, in order that each team can complete their objectives.

Get everybody to interact with the robot.

Remind people do not forget to write and practice their presentations.

## Laptops

You are in charge of distributing the Atio laptops between the different groups.

Every laptop bag contains a laptop, a charger and a USB mouse. Please make sure all are returned in the laptop bags at the end.

Each group shall receive at least one laptop. The hard drive of these laptops has been cloned, so each have the same tools.

| **Laptop Name** | **Group**          |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| makeathon 01    | Project Management |
| makeathon 02    | UI/UX              |
| makeathon 03    | Data Team          |
| makeathon 04    | ThingWorx Backend  |
| makeathon 05    | Analytics          |
| makeathon 06    |                    |
| makeathon 07    |                    |
| makeathon 08    |                    |

The Robot team probably do not require an Atio laptop, although you will be required to find them one, if they want to work on their presentation on the Atio laptop.
