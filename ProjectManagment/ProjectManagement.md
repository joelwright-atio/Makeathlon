# Project Management Guidence:

Your task is to lead an Agile team.

In your role as Project Managers, you need to know the tasks of the partisipants. You are responsible for the whole team finishing the tasks on time, to a high standard.

- Call regular stand up meetings.

- Document the project on Jira to track the tasks of each team, their progress and to calculate how they can be helped.

- Mix the teams so they do not work in silos. You have the power to move staff members around. You need to identifiy where teams have to interface with one another. For example, you will need to call together the Data Engieers, the UI/UX team, the ThingWorx Backend Team and the Analytics teams at different stages, in order that each team can compleate their objectives.

Get everybody to interact with the robot.

Remind people do not forget to organise their presentations.
